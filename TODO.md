## Short term

- [x] allow arbitrary input row length
- [ ] extract into public repo with only categorical prediction
- [x] try one-hot encoding for text, instead, where each column is a single letter, and the last column is the index of the letter predicted

## Long term

- somehow add simple LSTM capabilities to the tree
    - weights on nodes
    - backprop weights
